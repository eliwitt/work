			<h1 class="fancy_title">Typography<br />matters</h1>
			<p class="first">"There was once a typeface<br />
			that had the reputation of being<br />
			<span class="em1">more legible and functional</span><br />
			than all the others.</p>
			<p class="second">It was used everywhere and for<br /> 
			everything,<br />
			from signs to logos.<br />
			Then one day readers couldn't stand seeing it anymore and decided to stop reading it – despite its superior legibilty. Bit by bit designers forgot about it and it was only used by lay people. Then it was rediscovered for a while and in fashion again. Even books were published about it."</p>
